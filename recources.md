## Resources

[Department of Atmospheric and Climate Science](<https://atmos.uw.edu>) (Just in case you need it)

### Tutorial

- [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](<https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/>)
- [Learning Machine Learning with Lorenz-96](<https://m2lines.github.io/L96_demo/intro.html#>)
- [Statistical Machine Learning with R](https://teazrq.github.io/SMLR/)
  - This tutorial is written in R, but they provide many mathematical derivations of basic ML building blocks. No Neural Networks. 

### Specific Topics

- [The most complex model we actually understand](https://youtu.be/D8GOeCFFby4)
